In this code, we import the string module to get access to the punctuation constant, which is a string
containing all punctuation characters. We use the str.maketrans() method to create a translation table that maps;
each punctuation character to None, effectively removing them from the line.
Then, we use the lower() method to convert the line to lowercase,
and the split() method to split the line into a list of words.
Finally, we write the cleaned words back to the outfile by joining them with spaces using " ".join(words),
and append a newline character \n at the end of each line.
Make sure to adjust the file names "moby_01.txt" and "moby_01_clean.txt" to match your specific file names.
