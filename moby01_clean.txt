in this code we import the string module to get access to the punctuation constant which is a string
containing all punctuation characters we use the strmaketrans method to create a translation table that maps
each punctuation character to none effectively removing them from the line
then we use the lower method to convert the line to lowercase
and the split method to split the line into a list of words
finally we write the cleaned words back to the outfile by joining them with spaces using joinwords
and append a newline character n at the end of each line
make sure to adjust the file names moby01txt and moby01cleantxt to match your specific file names
